# Overview

XabarBot.UZ is a Flask-based web application that appears to be in its initial development stage. The project is set up as a basic Flask web server with minimal configuration, suggesting it's intended to be a notification or messaging bot service for Uzbekistan (based on the .UZ domain reference). The current implementation provides a foundation for a web-based bot service that can be extended with additional functionality.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Web Framework
- **Flask**: Chosen as the primary web framework for its simplicity and lightweight nature
- **Template Engine**: Uses Flask's built-in Jinja2 templating system with templates stored in the standard `templates/` directory
- **Configuration**: Basic Flask application setup with minimal configuration, suitable for rapid development and prototyping

## Application Structure
- **Monolithic Design**: Single-file application structure (`main.py`) indicating a simple, straightforward approach
- **Template-Based Rendering**: HTML templates are used for frontend presentation, following Flask's MVC pattern
- **Development-Ready**: Configured for direct execution with `app.run()` for development purposes

## Environment Management
- **Python-dotenv**: Included for environment variable management, though not yet implemented in the current codebase
- **Requirements Management**: Dependencies are clearly defined in `requirements.txt` for consistent development environments

# External Dependencies

## Python Packages
- **Flask 3.0.3**: Modern web framework for Python providing routing, templating, and HTTP handling
- **python-dotenv 1.0.0**: Environment variable management for configuration and secrets

## Runtime Environment
- **Python**: Requires Python runtime environment
- **Web Server**: Currently uses Flask's built-in development server (suitable for development, would need production WSGI server for deployment)

## Future Integration Considerations
- No database dependencies currently defined, but the project structure allows for easy integration of database solutions
- No external API integrations present, but the Flask framework supports REST API development
- No authentication mechanisms implemented, but Flask ecosystem provides various authentication options
